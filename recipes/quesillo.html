    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One the best desserts that I've ever tasted <em>Quesillo</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 Â¾ cups milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare a bain-marie, or water bath, by filling a 9-inch heat-proof container with water.</li>
        <li>Melt sugar in a nonstick pan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until melted, 7 to 10 minutes; be careful to keep it from burning. Pour sugar into a flan mold, coating the sides to ensure that the egg/milk mixture in the next step will not touch the container.</li>
        <li>Pour sweetened condensed milk into a bowl. Fill the empty can with milk and add to the bowl; stir in eggs and vanilla extract. Blend well. Fold mixture with a spatula or tap against the counter to remove air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Pour milk mixture into the slightly cooled flan mold. Put the lid on and place inside the water bath; don't let the water go over the rim.</li>
        <li>Bake the quesillo in the bain-marie in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Pry lid open with a knife carefully; continue baking until set, about 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Let quesillo cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Slide a knife around the edges of the mold to loosen and invert onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
